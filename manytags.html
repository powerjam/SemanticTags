  <h1>about</h1>
  
  <p>My name is Jamie Powers Do (pronounced like doe, a female deer). I grew up in the greater Seattle area and continue to live here for its lush landscapes, calm weather, and it being a tech hub.</p>
  
  <p>I signed up for this course given the relevancy to my current job. And while I learned web design as a hobby growing up, I am not up to speed on the latest front end development technologies.</p>

  <h1>education</h1>
  
  <p>I received both my undergrad and master's at the University of Washington - Seattle. My BA is in Business Administration from the Foster School of Business, with a double concentration in Information Systems and Human Resource Management (yes, HR is an actual major at UW).  I also got a minor in Diversity, which included some of the most interesting courses I've ever taken, observing minority-majority relations of different races, genders, etc.</p>
  
  <p>After a few years of work, I obtained my MS in Information Systems. Don't ask me what I learned! I mostly did it because Boeing has a generous educational benefit.</p>

  <h1>work</h1>
  
  <p>When I graduated, I went straight into a Big 4 firm in IT audit/risk/compliance/whatever you want to call it. I was essentially an external auditor; the kind of person most workers hate. I learned quickly that it was not the right career fit for me.</p>
  
  <p>After a couple of years in IT compliance, I accepted a role at Boeing as a Systems Analyst. I've only been there 2.5 years, but I've had a few roles since I joined: Functional Analyst, Product Owner, and now UX Designer.</p>
  
  <p>I really enjoy what I'm doing currently as UX Designer, which I'm still learning a lot as I go. We are working on a maintenance data delivery project where we are completely redesigning current systems into an entirely new website. I hope this certificate program will come in handy since we want our website to be modern and responsive for mobile access.</p>

  <h1>hobbies</h1>
  
  <p>My first and foremost favorite hobby is dancing. I've been a Polynesian dancer on and off since I was six, specifically Hula and Tahitian dancing. I also enjoy hiking, finding new restaurants (Yelp Elite!), working out (particularly a group class called "Boot Camp" for a quick and efficient workout), sociology, pyschology, and creative outlets such as photography and drawing or painting.</p>
